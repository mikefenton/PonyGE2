"""Hill-climbing is just about the simplest metaheuristic there
is. It's of interest in GP/GE because of the lingering suspicion among
many researchers that crossover just doesn't work. This goes back to
90s work by Chellapilla and by O'Reilly. Today, many papers are
published which use mutation only.

Even a simple hill-climber may work well in GP/GE. However, the main
purpose of this module is to provide two modern hill-climbing methods
proposed by Bykov: late-acceptance hill-climbing (LAHC) and
step-counting hill-climbing (SCHC). Both reduce to simple
hill-climbing (HC) with a particular parameter choice, so this module
provides HC as a by-product.

Both LAHC and SCHC are implemented as search_loop-type functions. They
don't provide/require a step-style function. Hence, to use these, just
pass the appropriate dotted function name:

--search_loop algorithm.hill_climbing.LAHC_loop
--search_loop algorithm.hill_climbing.SCHC_loop


LAHC is a hill-climbing algorithm with a history mechanism. The
history mechanism is very simple (one extra parameter: the length of
the history) but in some domains it seems to provide a remarkable
performance improvement compared to hill-climbing itself and other
heuristics. It hasn't previously been used in GP/GE.

LAHC was proposed by Bykov [http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~yxb/LAHC/LAHC-TR.pdf].

In standard hill-climbing, where we accept a move to a new proposed
point (created by mutation) if that point is as good as or better than
the current point.

In LAHC, we accept the move if the new point is as good as or better
than that we encountered L steps ago (L for history length).

LAHC is not to be confused with an acceptance to the GECCO
late-breaking papers track.

Step-counting hill-climbing
[http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10951-016-0469-x] is a
variant, proposed by Bykov as an improvement on LAHC. Although less
"natural" it may be slightly simpler to tune again. In SCHC, we
maintain a threshold cost value. We accept moves which are better than
that. We update it every L steps to the current cost value.

There are also two variants: instead of counting all steps, we can
count only accepted, or only improving moves.
